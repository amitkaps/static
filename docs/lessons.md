# Lessons

What setting up the repositories' builds and deploys taught, for whoever changes them next. Each lesson says what happened and what to do about it. Lessons that belong to one repository stay there, like SvelteKit's in base's `src/content/lessons.md`.

## pnpm

- **An exact pin with `onFail: error` breaks on every pnpm release.** A newer global pnpm refused to run with `ERR_PNPM_BAD_PM_VERSION`. `onFail: download` makes pnpm fetch and run the pinned version instead, which was tested with a global 12.10.1 and a pinned 12.9.1. A range in `devEngines` also works, but lets machines run different versions.
- **Some script names never run.** `pnpm deploy`, `pnpm audit`, `pnpm publish` and `pnpm ci` are pnpm's own commands, so a script by one of those names is skipped. That's why the deploy script is `ship` and the drift check is `drift`.
- **`npx` refuses to run in a repository whose `devEngines` names pnpm.** Use `pnpm exec` for an installed tool, and `pnpm dlx` for one that isn't.

## Vite+

- **Type-aware lint finds what the default lint misses.** Turning it on here flagged an `unknown` value in a template string in `drift.ts`. It needs no `typescript` dependency, since Vite+ installs tsgolint. With `typeCheck: true` it also reports compiler errors, like `TS2322`, so `check` replaces `tsc`.
- **There's no `vp fix`.** `vp check --fix` writes the format and lint fixes, so `check` and `fix` are one command with and without a flag. `vp check` also runs the type check when `typeCheck` is on, so `vp lint && vp fmt --check` was doing the same job in two steps.
- **With no `fmt` block, `vp fmt` prints "No config found, using defaults."** It still passes. An empty `fmt: {}` keeps the defaults and drops the notice.

## The survey

- **The Cloudflare build can't see the other repositories.** Workers Builds clones only this one, so a survey that read sibling folders found nothing there. It reads them from GitHub's `main` instead, which is public and needs no token. A GitHub outage shows in the table rather than failing the build, so it never blocks a deploy.

- **Checking versions found drift the setup checks missed.** prose asked for Node 24 in `devEngines`, had no vite override at all, and two repositories were a minor release behind on markz. Each was a version nobody had looked at since it was set. A tool this repository doesn't use is compared with npm's latest, read at build time.

- **One script name ran two commands.** ship and base ran `prose .`, and markz and sitez ran `prose`. prose reads `build` only as its first argument, so `pnpm prose build` became `prose . build` in two of them. The script is `prose` alone, since it reads the current folder anyway, and the survey checks it.

## Moving base back

- **A framework needs steps around `vp check`.** SvelteKit generates `$app/tsconfig` and the Worker's types, so `svelte-kit sync` and `wrangler types` run first, and oxlint doesn't type-check `.svelte` files, so `svelte-check` runs after. The standard holds `check` to running `vp check`, not to being only that. `fix` stays exact.
- **Moving between toolchains needs a fresh lockfile.** A lockfile keeps the optional peers it already resolved, so base needed `node_modules` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` removed before installing.
- **Dependabot can't bump Vite+ alone.** The override in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` has to move with it, and Dependabot doesn't edit that file, so it ignores `vite-plus`. Vite+ moves from here, in every repository at once.
- **wrangler.jsonc hides its comments from prose.** prose reads comments in `.toml` but not `.jsonc`, so a repository still on wrangler uses `wrangler.toml`.

## GitHub and agents

- **Five repositories protected `main` four ways.** Classic protection in two, with different settings, a ruleset in one, and nothing in two, including this one. A ruleset is one JSON document, so it can live here and be applied everywhere with `gh api`, which classic protection can't do as cleanly.
- **GitHub shows a public repository's branch rules to anyone, but not its merge settings.** `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/rules/branches/main` works without a login, so the home page checks the rules. Settings like squash-only need the owner's token, so `pnpm drift --github` checks those.
- **Copied rules drift.** The `@prose` rules were copied into four `AGENTS.md` files and had already started to differ. Each `AGENTS.md` now links to the one copy in prose's docs, and the survey checks the link section is the same everywhere.

## Releases

- **Three copies of one release workflow had drifted.** markz staged with pnpm and sent pre-releases to `next`. prose and sitez staged with npm from a temporary folder, and skipped a version already on npm. Only markz ran its size budget, and only markz had labels, so prose's notes listed every pull request, plans included. The workflow now names no package, so one file is copied everywhere and checked word for word.
- **publint needn't be a separate step.** `vp pack` runs it with `publint: { strict: true }` in the `pack` block, and fails the build on a problem, which was tested by pointing `exports` at a missing file. It needs `publint` installed, or the pack fails with "Failed to import module".
- **A summary in an annotated tag can't be reviewed or fixed.** markz's breaking release put what to change in the tag's message. It's now the description of the pull request that bumps the version, which is reviewed like any change, and the workflow reads it from the tagged commit.
- **pnpm won't run on a Node older than `devEngines` asks for.** It stops with `ERR_PNPM_BAD_RUNTIME_VERSION`, so a CI job on Node 24 can't call `pnpm test`. Install on Node 26, switch to 24, and run `node_modules/.bin/vp test --run`. sitez's 285 tests passed that way. Vite+ 1.1.0 itself supports Node 22.18 and 24.11 and up.
- **Bundling our own packages removes the release order.** prose already had markz as a dev dependency, inside its `dist/`, so it depends on nothing at install time. sitez's published types never mention markz, so it can do the same, and then any package can release at any time.

## Cloudflare

- **The Git integration deploys whether or not GitHub CI passed.** The fix is a build command that runs the checks. `pnpm run verify` fails first, and nothing deploys.
- **The build and deploy commands can't live in the repository.** `cloudflare.config.ts` has no field for them, as of cf 1.0.0-beta.14 and `@cloudflare/config` 0.24.1. So the dashboard holds two commands that never change, and `package.json` decides what they run.
- **The Git integration installs dependencies itself.** A build command that starts with `pnpm install &&` installs twice.
- **The integration reads pnpm's version from the repository, but not Node's.** Set `NODE_VERSION` on every Worker, or `devEngines` stops the build on the default Node.
- **cf can't deploy SvelteKit yet.** The adapter doesn't write cf's Build Output, so base stays on wrangler. Its lessons have the detail.
- **cf deploys an assets-only Vite site.** `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` with `assetsOnly: true` writes the Build Output, and `cf deploy --prebuilt` uploads it.
- **cf can't deploy a folder that Vite didn't build.** Tried on markz, whose site `prose build` writes into `.prose`. cf's config has no `assets.directory`, as of cf 1.0.0-beta.14 and `@cloudflare/config` 0.24.1. Without `--prebuilt`, `cf deploy` delegates to wrangler. `cf pages deploy` takes a folder, but that's Pages, not a Worker. So markz and prose stay on wrangler, held, until cf's config takes a folder.
- **cf has no command to rename a Worker, but the dashboard does.** Settings → General → Name renames it in place, keeping its ID, Git connection and domains. Rename it there first, then change the name in the config, since a different name in the config deploys to a different Worker.
- **Reconnecting a repository resets the Worker's build settings.** After the GitHub repository was renamed and reconnected, the commands went back to `pnpm run build` and `npx wrangler deploy`, `NODE_VERSION` was gone, the cache was off and previews were on. Check them after any reconnect, with `pnpm drift --cloudflare`.
- **The config lists the Worker's domains too.** Change a domain in the dashboard and in `cloudflare.config.ts` together, so a deploy can't put the old one back.
- **cf needs `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` when the login has several accounts.** It won't pick one in a script.

## Docs

- **A hand-written `.html` page ships its comments.** Vite doesn't strip them, so a `<!-- @prose -->` would show in the page source. Pages here carry no prose, and the README says what they are.
