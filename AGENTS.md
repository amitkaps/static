# AGENTS.md

This repository holds the standard every repository follows, and is its working example. Read [docs/standard.md](docs/standard.md) first, then [docs/lessons.md](docs/lessons.md).

## Standard

This repository follows the standard at [ship](https://ship.amitkaps.com), which sets how every repository builds, checks and deploys. Read [ship's docs/standard.md](https://github.com/amitkaps/ship/blob/main/docs/standard.md) before changing any of that.

- Change the toolchain, scripts, versions or deploys in ship first, then bring each repository in line. Don't change them in one repository alone.
- Work on a branch and open a pull request. CI runs `pnpm run verify`, which must pass, and the pull request is squash-merged. Nobody pushes to `main`.
- Run tools through `pnpm run …` and `pnpm exec`, not global installs.
- A held check on ship's page is a tool's limit, not a choice. Leave it until its reason goes away.

## Prose

Explanations go in `@prose` comments, written to the rules in [prose's usage](https://prose.amitkaps.com/docs/usage.md#for-agents). Read them before writing prose. They live there and aren't copied here, so every repository writes to the same rules.

## This repository

- A change to how things are done is a change to the standard. Make it here first, in the config, in `docs/standard.md` and, when it's checkable, in `scripts/survey.ts`. Then `pnpm drift` lists the repositories to bring in line.
- What a change taught goes in `docs/lessons.md`, in the same change. Say what happened and what to do about it.
- The `.html` pages carry no prose, since their comments ship to the browser.
- Don't name a script after a pnpm command (`deploy`, `publish`, `audit`, `ci`, `pipeline`, `pack`).
