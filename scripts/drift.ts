/** @prose
 * # Drift
 *
 * Prints where each repository has drifted from the standard, from what
 * [survey.ts](survey.ts) finds, and exits 1 when anything has. It reads the other repositories
 * from GitHub's `main`, as the site does, or from the folders beside this one with `--local`.
 *
 * `--cloudflare` also reads each Worker's build settings from Cloudflare, which needs `cf`
 * logged in and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` set. A held check is printed with its reason, and doesn't
 * count as drift. That check stays here and off the site, since
 * the build has no Cloudflare login.
 *
 * `--github` also reads each repository's merge settings, which GitHub shows only to its owner, so
 * it needs `gh` logged in. They're compared with [.github/settings.json](../.github/settings.json).
