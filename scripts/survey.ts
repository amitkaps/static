 * # The survey
 *
 * Reads every repository and checks it against the standard, returning what it found as data.
 * `pnpm drift` prints it, and the build turns it into the tables on the site's home page.
 *
 * The standard is this repository's own settings, read from its files, so there's no second
 * copy of it to keep in step. [docs/standard.md](../docs/standard.md) says what each check means.
 *
 * The other repositories are read from GitHub, from `main`, so a check run on a laptop and the
 * one Cloudflare runs at build time see the same thing. Cloudflare's build clones only this
 * repository, so the sibling folders on disk aren't there. This repository is read from disk,
 * since that's the commit being built. `local` reads the siblings from disk too, to check a fix
 * before it's pushed.
