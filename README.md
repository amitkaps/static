# ship

How every repository builds, checks and deploys, kept as one working example. [The standard](docs/standard.md) says what the one way is, and [the lessons](docs/lessons.md) say why. This repository follows it exactly, and `pnpm drift` checks the others against it.

It's also a live site, at `ship.amitkaps.com`: a minimal static site, with one `index.html` and a `404.html`, built with Vite+ and deployed to Cloudflare with cf. Any new site starts by copying it. The home page shows the drift check as two tables, the checks and every repository's scripts, as of the last deploy.

```sh
# needs Node 26: package.json (devEngines) pins it, and pnpm fetches its own pinned version
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # local dev server
pnpm verify       # check + build: what CI and every deploy run
pnpm ship         # upload the last build (normally left to the Git integration)
pnpm prose        # read the repository as a document
pnpm drift        # check every repository against the standard, as of GitHub's main
pnpm drift --local  # the same, from the checkouts next to this one
```

## What's here

```text
index.html, 404.html    the site's two pages
vite.config.ts          the build: Vite+, and the Cloudflare plugin
cloudflare.config.ts    the Worker: name, domain and asset handling
pnpm-workspace.yaml     pnpm's settings, the same in every repository
.github/workflows/      CI, which runs pnpm run verify
docs/                   the standard and its lessons
scripts/                the survey, pnpm drift, and the home page's tables
tsconfig.json           the strict type checks, which lint runs
```

## Deploy

The Worker `ship` is connected to this repository, and each push to `main` builds and deploys it. Its dashboard settings are the ones every Worker has, listed in [the standard](docs/standard.md#cloudflare).

## Beta packages

Two packages are still beta. Check them with `pnpm view <name> dist-tags`.

| Package                   | Pinned                     | Status (2026-10-09)                 | Done when                      |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` | `2.0.0-beta.sha-91c870c02` | `beta` tag only; `latest` is 1.63.1 | `latest` is a 2.x release      |
| `cf`                      | `1.0.0-beta.14`            | `latest` is the beta                | `latest` is a non-beta release |

When a package graduates, update the pins in `package.json` and the table above. Then run `pnpm run verify` and a deploy from the Git-connected Worker before you rely on it.
